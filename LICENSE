*Other Notes: Insert year software was first published as well as any subsequent 
years when a modified version is published. Publication is defined in the U.S. 
Copyright Act as the distribution or offer of distribution of a work to the public 
by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental, lease, or lending. Since some 
keyboards or fonts cannot reproduce the © symbol, the symbol (c) may be used instead, 
although the latter will not always be accepted as a substitute for the former. 
Use of the symbol "©" in combination with certain other requirements affords copyright 
protection in some foreign countries.
